  <h2>Summary</h2>
  </p>
  <p>If your corporate culture is inclusive and gives opportunities to young people like me, who are enthusiastically
    looking to join a team where they can learn from the best in IT, don't hesitate to get to know me. I want to develop
    a career within the scope of my skills and I will dedicate myself fully to any projects that may challenge me. I
    want to grow any company that is willing to make me grow with it.</p>
  <p>I had the privilege of starting work in Coimbra (at One Source – curricular internship – and at IPN) as a Helpdesk
    Technician and at the moment I want to work in the Lisbon Region and reinforce skills in the Networks or Programming
    area.</p>
  <p>If you are looking for someone with desire, dynamism, professionalism, dedication and who really enjoys working in
    a
    team and sharing ideas, don't hesitate. Detailed analysis of my Linkedin profile and CV is a start.</p>
